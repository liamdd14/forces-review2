      {
        question: "A book rests on a table. Which statement is true about the forces acting on the book?",
        options: [
          "Gravity pulls down, and the table pushes up with an equal normal force",
          "Gravity pulls down stronger than the table pushes up",
          "The table pushes up stronger than gravity pulls down",
          "Only gravity acts on the book since it's not moving"
        ],
        correct: 0,
        explanation: "When an object is at rest on a surface, the normal force from the surface equals the gravitational force, resulting in zero net force (equilibrium)."
      },
      {
        question: "You're pulling a box across the floor at constant speed. What can you say about the friction force?",
        options: [
          "Friction is zero because the box is moving",
          "Friction equals your pulling force",
          "Friction is greater than your pulling force",
          "Friction is less than your pulling force"
        ],
        correct: 1,
        explanation: "At constant speed, there's no acceleration, so net force is zero. This means the friction force must equal your pulling force in magnitude but opposite in direction."
      },
      {
        question: "A spring is compressed by 2 cm. If you compress it by 4 cm instead, how does the spring force change?",
        options: [
          "The force stays the same",
          "The force doubles",
          "The force quadruples",
          "The force is cut in half"
        ],
        correct: 1,
        explanation: "Spring force follows Hooke's Law (F = kx), which is linear. If you double the compression distance, the force doubles."
      },
      {
        question: "Two boxes rest on a table: one weighs 5 kg and one weighs 10 kg. Which experiences a larger normal force?",
        options: [
          "The 5 kg box",
          "The 10 kg box",
          "They experience the same normal force",
          "Neither experiences a normal force"
        ],
        correct: 1,
        explanation: "The heavier box (10 kg) has more gravitational force pulling down, so the table must push up with a larger normal force to keep it in equilibrium."
      },
      {
        question: "A picture hangs from the ceiling by a string. What provides the upward force that balances the picture's weight?",
        options: [
          "Normal force from the ceiling",
          "Tension in the string",
          "Air resistance",
          "The picture's own momentum"
        ],
        correct: 1,
        explanation: "The tension force in the string pulls upward on the picture, balancing the downward gravitational force and keeping the picture in equilibrium."
      },
      {
        question: "You push a heavy box but it doesn't move. Which statement is correct?",
        options: [
          "There is no friction since the box isn't moving",
          "Static friction equals your pushing force",
          "Static friction is less than your pushing force",
          "Kinetic friction is preventing motion"
        ],
        correct: 1,
        explanation: "When the box doesn't move, static friction matches your pushing force exactly (up to its maximum limit). Kinetic friction only acts on moving objects."
      },
      {
        question: "An elevator accelerates upward. How does the normal force on a person inside compare to their weight?",
        options: [
          "Normal force is less than weight",
          "Normal force equals weight",
          "Normal force is greater than weight",
          "There is no normal force in an elevator"
        ],
        correct: 2,
        explanation: "To accelerate upward, there must be a net upward force. The normal force from the floor must be greater than the person's weight to provide this upward acceleration."
      },
      {
        question: "A stretched spring pulls a block toward it. If you increase the stretch distance, what happens to the acceleration of the block?",
        options: [
          "Acceleration decreases",
          "Acceleration stays the same",
          "Acceleration increases",
          "Acceleration becomes zero"
        ],
        correct: 2,
        explanation: "Greater stretch means greater spring force (F = kx). With more force and the same mass, acceleration increases (F = ma)."
      },
      {
        question: "A spring with spring constant k is stretched by distance x. Another identical spring is stretched by distance 3x. How do the forces compare?",
        options: [
          "The second spring has 3 times the force",
          "The second spring has 9 times the force",
          "Both springs have the same force",
          "The second spring has 1/3 the force"
        ],
        correct: 0,
        explanation: "Spring force is proportional to stretch distance (F = kx). Triple the stretch means triple the force for the same spring constant."
      },
      {
        question: "You drag a suitcase across a carpeted floor at constant velocity. What happens if you suddenly double your pulling force?",
        options: [
          "The suitcase continues at constant velocity",
          "The suitcase accelerates forward",
          "The suitcase decelerates",
          "The suitcase stops moving"
        ],
        correct: 1,
        explanation: "At constant velocity, your pull equals friction. Doubling your pull creates a net forward force (pull > friction), causing forward acceleration."
      },
      {
        question: "A person stands in an elevator that moves upward at constant velocity. How does the normal force compare to their weight?",
        options: [
          "Normal force is greater than weight",
          "Normal force equals weight",
          "Normal force is less than weight",
          "Normal force is zero"
        ],
        correct: 1,
        explanation: "Constant velocity means zero acceleration and zero net force. The normal force must exactly equal the person's weight for equilibrium."
      },
      {
        question: "Two identical boxes are stacked on top of each other on a table. How does the normal force from the table compare to the normal force on the box on top?",
        options: [
          "The same as the box on top",
          "Twice as large as the box on top",
          "Half as large as the box on top",
          "Four times as large as the box on top"
        ],
        correct: 1,
        explanation: "The table must support the weight of both boxes. The box on top only supports its own weight, but the table supports twice that weight, so the normal force doubles."
      },
      {
        question: "A rope hangs from the ceiling with a 10 kg mass at the bottom. What is the tension in the rope where it connects to the ceiling?",
        options: [
          "Zero, because the mass pulls down not up",
          "Equal to the weight of the 10 kg mass",
          "Half the weight of the mass",
          "Twice the weight of the mass"
        ],
        correct: 1,
        explanation: "The rope must support the entire weight of the mass. The tension throughout the rope (including at the ceiling) equals the weight of the hanging mass."
      },
      {
        question: "A compressed spring pushes two blocks apart. One block has twice the mass of the other. Which block experiences more force from the spring?",
        options: [
          "The heavier block",
          "The lighter block",
          "Both experience the same force",
          "Neither experiences a force"
        ],
        correct: 2,
        explanation: "The spring pushes on both blocks with equal force (Newton's third law - action and reaction). The lighter block will accelerate more, but the forces are equal."
      },
      {
        question: "You push on a wall with 50 N of force. The wall doesn't move. What force does the wall exert on you?",
        options: [
          "0 N, because the wall doesn't move",
          "25 N pushing back",
          "50 N pushing back",
          "100 N pushing back"
        ],
        correct: 2,
        explanation: "Newton's third law: for every action there's an equal and opposite reaction. The wall pushes back on you with exactly 50 N."
      },
      {
        question: "A book slides across a table and gradually slows down. What type of friction is acting on it?",
        options: [
          "Static friction",
          "Kinetic friction",
          "Rolling friction",
          "No friction"
        ],
        correct: 1,
        explanation: "Kinetic (sliding) friction acts on objects that are moving relative to a surface. This friction opposes motion and causes the book to slow down."
      },
      {
        question: "An astronaut in space (far from any planets) pushes on a floating toolbox. What happens to the astronaut?",
        options: [
          "Nothing, the astronaut stays still",
          "The astronaut moves in the same direction as the toolbox",
          "The astronaut moves in the opposite direction to the toolbox",
          "The astronaut spins in place"
        ],
        correct: 2,
        explanation: "Newton's third law: when the astronaut pushes the toolbox, the toolbox pushes back equally. This causes the astronaut to move backward."
      },
      {
        question: "A spring scale shows 20 N when you hang a mass from it. If you hang the same mass from two identical springs (one below the other), what does the top spring scale read?",
        options: [
          "10 N",
          "20 N",
          "40 N",
          "0 N"
        ],
        correct: 1,
        explanation: "The top spring must support the entire weight of the mass (plus the bottom spring's negligible weight). It still reads 20 N."
      },
      {
        question: "A box sits on a frictionless surface. You push it horizontally. What happens when you stop pushing?",
        options: [
          "The box immediately stops",
          "The box gradually slows down",
          "The box continues at constant velocity",
          "The box accelerates faster"
        ],
        correct: 2,
        explanation: "With no friction and no applied force, there's no net force on the box. By Newton's first law, it continues moving at constant velocity."
      },
      {
        question: "Static friction can be at most 40 N for a particular box on a floor. You push with 30 N but the box doesn't move. What is the friction force?",
        options: [
          "0 N",
          "30 N",
          "40 N",
          "70 N"
        ],
        correct: 1,
        explanation: "Static friction adjusts to match your push up to its maximum. Since the box doesn't move, static friction exactly equals your 30 N push."
      },
      {
        question: "A 5 kg mass and a 10 kg mass hang from opposite ends of a rope over a pulley. Which experiences greater tension from the rope?",
        options: [
          "The 5 kg mass",
          "The 10 kg mass",
          "Both experience the same tension",
          "Neither experiences tension"
        ],
        correct: 2,
        explanation: "The tension in an ideal rope is the same throughout. Both masses feel the same tension force from the rope, even though their weights differ."
      },
      {
        question: "You compress a spring by hand until it pushes back with 100 N. How hard are you pushing on the spring?",
        options: [
          "0 N",
          "50 N",
          "100 N",
          "200 N"
        ],
        correct: 2,
        explanation: "Newton's third law: the spring pushes on you with the same force you push on it. You must be pushing with 100 N for the spring to push back with 100 N."
      },
      {
        question: "A horizontal rope pulls a sled forward with 50 N of tension. Friction pulls backward with 30 N. What is the net force on the sled?",
        options: [
          "20 N forward",
          "20 N backward",
          "80 N forward",
          "0 N"
        ],
        correct: 0,
        explanation: "Net force is the sum of all forces. 50 N forward minus 30 N backward equals 20 N forward. This net force causes acceleration."
      },
      {
        question: "Two people pull on opposite ends of a rope in a tug-of-war. One pulls with 200 N, the other with 200 N. What is the tension in the rope?",
        options: [
          "0 N",
          "200 N",
          "400 N",
          "100 N"
        ],
        correct: 1,
        explanation: "Tension in the rope equals the pull from one person (either one), not both added together. The rope has 200 N of tension throughout."
      },
      {
        question: "A spring is compressed and held in place. When released, it pushes a toy car forward. What happens to the spring force as the car moves away and the spring returns to its natural length?",
        options: [
          "The spring force increases",
          "The spring force stays constant",
          "The spring force decreases",
          "The spring force reverses direction"
        ],
        correct: 2,
        explanation: "As the spring returns to its natural length, the compression decreases. Since spring force is proportional to compression distance (F = kx), less compression means less force."
